/**
 * Generate a Loadable store that is considered 'loaded' after resolving synchronous or asynchronous behavior.
 * This behavior may be derived from the value of parent Loadable or non Loadable stores.
 * If so, this store will begin loading only after the parents have loaded.
 * This store is also writable. It includes a `set` function that will immediately update the value of the store
 * and then execute provided asynchronous behavior to persist this change.
 * @param stores Any readable or array of Readables whose value is used to generate the asynchronous behavior of this store.
 * Any changes to the value of these stores post-load will restart the asynchronous behavior of the store using the new values.
 * @param mappingLoadFunction A function that takes in the values of the stores and generates a Promise that resolves
 * to the final value of the store when the asynchronous behavior is complete.
 * @param mappingWriteFunction A function that takes in the new value of the store and uses it to perform async behavior.
 * Typically this would be to persist the change. If this value resolves to a value the store will be set to it.
 * @param options Modifiers for store behavior.
 * @param start Start stop notifier.
 * @returns A Loadable store whose value is set to the resolution of provided async behavior.
 * The loaded value of the store will be ready after awaiting the load function of this store.
